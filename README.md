# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Combat-Calculator
A simple executable designed to understand some general statistics about a Dungeons and Dragons combat encounter


Unfortunately, I have since lost the source code for this software and am no longer able to update or modify it. I was thankfully able to find an old backup
of my computer's desktop which contained the executable. As such, this is the only surviving aspect of this project.
