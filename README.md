# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Combat-Calculator
A simple executable designed to understand some general statistics about a Dungeons and Dragons combat encounter such as Minimum and Maximum damage, and chance to hit.


Unfortunately, I have since lost the source code for this software and am no longer able to update or modify it. The only reason this exists is because a random Google Drive backup of my desktop at the time contained this executable. As such, this is the only surviving aspect of this project.
